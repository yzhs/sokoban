* Clean up UI code
* Add a background image?
* Nicer walls
* Better error handling, e.g. responses when
  - hitting walls
  - hitting multiple crates
  - trying to undo with 0 moves done
  - trying to redo past the list of recorded moves
  - trying to go to the next level when the current one has never been solved
  - trying to go past the first or last level in a collection
* Add a level editor
